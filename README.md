# Gateway to Connect the IoT (Internet of Things) Network and the Blockchain Network

Blockchain can become an alternative solution in managing and storing IoT data. In this repo, the integration between the Internet of Things and the blockchain is to develop a gateway as an intermediary in terms of sending sensor data. Using Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric and Composer, the result is gateway is able to receive data from sensor nodes, manage data structures and send them to the blockchain network. In addition, the authentication mechanism was also successfully provided in order to validate the gateway as a form of limiting access to the blockchain network.
